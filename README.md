- Greeting, I am @LogansBrain: Real Programmer (Not VIBE Coder)
- I started programming on an IBM PC running IBM-DOS 1.01
- My main languages were: BASIC(A), IBM Pascal, Macro Assembler and later Turbo Pascal, Turbo C/C++/ASM
- In the 90s I did some Windows application development primarily using Delphi, Visual BASIC and Access/SQL.
- Lately I have been goofing around with Python, Go & GoDot as well as learning scripting in BASH and POWERSHELL.
- I am familiar with PC/MS/DR-DOS, Windows, MacOS, and Linux with some experience in Minix, UNIX,  CP/M, OS/2, and AmigaOS.
- I am interesting in systems programming, application development, DBMS, networking, and security (Penetration Testing/Social Engineering).
