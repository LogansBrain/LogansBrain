- Hi, I’m @LogansBrain
- I started programming on an IBM PC running DOS 1.01
- My main languages were: BASIC(A), IBM Pascal, Macro Assembler and later Turbo Pascal, Turbo C/C++/ASM
- In the 90s I did some Windows programming primarily Delphi, Visual BASIC and Access/SQL.
- After spending a lot of time away from the technical side of computers, I am looking to learn new programming concepts, techniques and languages. I am also looking to expand my networking and security knowledge.
- Lately I have been goofing around with Python & GoDot
